### What I do

Hey there! I'm CÃ©sar. I am a former electrical engineer turned software developer. I am also an entrepreneur and have co-founded a few companies. You can find my blog here: https://cesardelsolar.com

I am currently CTO of CodeComet, a startup in the dev tools / test observability space. Check us out at https://codecomet.io. I previously was a late cofounder at a YC startup named Leftronic; we were acquired in 2014.

### Scrabble and Word Games

I have been working on a few Scrabble-related projects in my spare time. I am a top 20 tournament player in North America, which is where the interest comes from. My projects are:

- https://woogles.io - I co-founded a 501c3 non-profit named Woogles, which focuses on word gaming and education. The codebase is AGPLv3 and can be found here: https://github.com/woogles-io/liwords.
- https://domino14.github.io/macondo - the best Scrabble AI in the world (need proof, though). GPLv3 licensed.
- https://aerolith.org - a GPLv3 licensed word study site. Been working on this one since 2007 in various forms

If you would like to help out with any of my open-source projects please let me know!
